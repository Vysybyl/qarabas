The city welcomes us in grey and with no horizon. Y. got a flat for us alone, in a residential zone close to the park ("close to" means twenty minutes walking) in a neighborhood that might be central. 

For the first time we live on a couple's stage.

We are friends. Thus, we fight as good friends, talking in silence, back from the suggested restaurant. I let the wall grow without noticing it, so easily that now it seems disgusting, and I let myself fall behind it, trapped by the rails of my highest thoughts.

We actually speak only once we are home, sitting on pillows arranged on the rope carpet in front of the couch - left behind in its main purpose.

Outside it's raining almost uninterruptedly and there is no water in the house. The owner, a friend of Y., is unreachable. I feel annoyed as a spoiled kid but I am able to hide it only behind words. The issue is not in the taps.

I don't know who speaks first. Y., I guess. I try to give and get a hug or a caress and Y. pushes me away as a good mirror. I feel manipulative and wrong. Despicable. I know she's right.

There are some exchanged apologies which sound more like "we are far apart, we are far apart..." The metropolis surrouds us, stares at us waiting for our movements. I have failed. I do not know what but I have failed.

Y. is in the other room preparing to get out by herself. I feel on my chest an overwhelming sadness. I drop on the couch and I start gasping bug-eyed. The air in and out as sea waves. The rain outside. On the floor next to that couch Y. shared with me the listening of a message from her dad. Or will share, I don't remember the chronology anymore. I even went to the park three times. 

I'm thinking about my dad. The breath turned into a repeated moan and I know that Y. can hear it. I hate her for not coming running at my despair. I'm not playing anymore! I'm still thinking about my dad, this tiny man who crossed two continents and a country without speaking any language but his own one. I think that his story will never be told, because every time I questioned him he gave me different versions, fragmented and conflicting: it will die with him. Is Y. not coming yet?! I see this mistaken tiny man sacrificing himself for me and his sons like the great men sacrifice themselves for some ideas. Years. I don't understand him. Not even a book.

The weight on my chest melts in waves of love. I'm crying. I won't ever be able to tell his story and maybe it won't find any memory but this one. I can't reciprocate. Y. finally comes and becomes mother, without judging or pitying me. Her silent hug.

The next day I send just a message to my father. I do it almost as a ritual action. Some hours later over the phone I'll just mention my melancoly and he will recall my grandfather an the fact that between his death and my birth there are exactly five years.

The night when Y. is busy with family obligations I find myself looking nervously for some kind of entertainment at the end of the afternoon spent in front of the screen. I stumble towards a cultural center that is just two blocks away. Even the grey sky turns black.

It's a play inspired by a personal story. A monologue. She, the daughter, brings us some fragments of the relationship with her dad, who spent the last years of his life dumb after vocal cord surgery. They make us sit in a circle. She enters soaked in frozen water, barefoot, shaking, with a simple dress of synthetic fabric - sleeveless and cut to the knee. She sits next to me and it seems to me that I can feel her shivering under her curls. She carries on the lap a shoebox that - she will tell - contains all the last messages from her dad.

The actress stares at us with her back straight. Then she speaks.
