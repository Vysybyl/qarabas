Sometimes groups of runaway slaves took shelter in remote areas funding small hidden villages; some of those still exist today.

What I call Kulumboo is an eco-village on the coast, located between a huge coconut plantation and the mouth of a small river two hours walking from the nearest town. I get there in one hour on a shuttle jeep, paying four times the average price for the same distance on a public bus. I know two types of communities: squats and those which survive by squeezing the visitors. Kulumboo seems to be of the second type.

Together with me on the jeep there are three women who are attending a self-development course at the village and a couple, Tex and Domitille. I met her shortly before in a pastry shop. I helped her taking a liquor from the last shelf, to which she replied with a blonde and slightly contemptuous "thanks" - very French, I thought. Instead, we become friends while the bags are loaded on the car's hood, and I discover that they are both Latin Americans. I sit in the back with Tex.

I am tall, but compared to him I feel delicate. His skin is baked by several surf seasons and he's got a sort of a scar under the right eye, of which I will not ask the story. In between the car's bumps, trying to leverage on our legs in order not to be shaken too much, we speak about practical things: work, internet connections in remote areas, bio-construction. He's a lawyer, he tells me, and he is working remotely too. We share some doubts on the good faith of Kulumboo's economical system.

When we arrive it must be around seven and it's already dark. I rapidly find myself alone. The two girls at the reception are not particularly interested in helping me, but I have a map drawn on the diary, the light of the mobile phone and the directions to reach the house that hosts the room that I rent, at the end of the village. All constructions are one or two stores high, surrounded by wide stretches of more or less thick vegetation. After about ten minutes I reach a group of three houses. I discard the one with the washing-machine ("we only have the washtub" I remember the owner saying) and I point to the second one. It's the right one.

The jungle at night makes a hell of a racket.

My days at Kulumboo run away too fast. Sitting seven or eight hours in front of the PC becomes very difficult after I've seen the river mouth and the sea. Mosquitoes give me no rest and, after having hoped in the infinite power of lavander essential oil, I end up using a long-sleeved shirt, trousers and socks for all the time I spend working. At the end of the afternoon I change and throw myself into the water.

The life at the village is strictly linked to the rithm of the sun: at 10 PM everyone is already sleeping; nevertheless, I am able to have a swim every day, some nice chats with my hosts and a guided meditation in one of the common tents. Maybe because of my distrustful gaze, I feel I'm not looked for by the people around me. I am not even able to hang around with Tex and Domi every day. The loneliness is big but full and alive. It's not urban despair.

Under the shower, my skinny arms look like they belong to somebody else's body. The water is hot and with the new moon the walls get crowded with bugs, a praying mantis, a millipede and some moths. I do not know the names of all the animals that may bite me.

Often at night the house remains empty. I take the risk of opening the wide glass doors that lead to the dark garden. Laying on the hammock, I play gently some greek and eastern scales.

It is only on the second to last day, a Saturday, that I have time for a full recognition. After working for some more hours in the morning, I wander around the village carrying my backpack. They warned me about the thefts (the last one happened two days before) and for this reason I hold tight to the five-kilogram Dell hanging from my shoulders; even when I enter the water under a rain-threatening sky, I tie the backpack to a bench and I put it so that its wan orange color can still be seen from far away.

"Two or three *capangas* with a couple of guns can comb the entire village, house by house, before the police may arrive" said Tex, mentioning the fact that the house they sleep in has no locks. Mine neither. He comes from the metropolis. And he's a laywer.

That day I meet them at the mouth. I give the *tiramis√π*'s recipe to Domi while we wallow in the warm water, but we are all leaving the next morning and I want to have a last glance at this ocean.

I leave them in the river, just their heads arising from the mirror that reflects the lead grey sky and the first buildings of the village. I have to cross a streak of land about a hundred meters wide to reach the sea. I see it. For the first time there is nobody. Nobody nowhere. Not on the beach, not in the water. You can't distinguish a single figure in the plantation or at the river mouth, after which the plants go on extending in regular rows for as far as the eye can see.

I start running up and down along the coast, and screaming at the top of my lungs: "Ooooh!" for all the duration of the breath, making the call ring high in the nasal cavity and against the wavefronts. I skip. I do a couple of cartwheels. The sky above me is swallen with clouds. The waves call. The warmth of the water when my right foot touches it reassures me. I keep on howling, walking in quick steps lashing out the wave tops, swirling my arms, until a wave wets my waist. My excitement slows down and the howl appeases. I look at the sea breathing like a gigantig being. The sound of the backwash and the water pushing against my body make me feel that it is aware of my presence.

"Show me something!" - I scream, and the wave replies rumbling.

"Show me something!" I scream louder, hitting the palms on the water surface.

"I am here!" I scream, walking towards the wave with a threatening move. "Show me something!"

"I am here! I am here!"

I squirm. I almost try to run towards it.

"I am here! Show me something!"

"I am here!" I answer to the wave.

"I am here!" I scream again before letting myself fall forward.

"I am here!" I scream raising up. And I dive again.

Sea, sea and more sea. Its body and mine communicate like two lovers in a fight. Show me something. 

"I am here!" - the voice in my throat

"I am here!" - now sounds alien

"I am here!" - and the sweet power of the waves

"I am here!" - that growls against me

"I am here!" - condenses in this statement

"I am here".

I let myself fall one last time and I seek rest into the water.

I am here.

That night I woke up around four. A mosquito was able to sneak under the patched net that hangs over my mattress. I engage in a hunt for some endless minutes: any time that the mobile light is on, the predator disappears; when I see it landing on a fold of fabric my attack is too slow and clumsy to hit it. After a while I give up, sticking my face into the pillow with just the left eye open and dazzled by the phone's flashlight that illuminates the net above me. I start dwelling on my past. I count one, two, three women that I loved and that have completelly disappeared from my life. "Why?", I ask myself. "Why?!"

The question in Kulumboo's night seems legitimate and sincere. I let it float on the pillow for a while. Then I hug it.

"Enough".

I let the tears out. I feel something inside me felling into place. I take the diary and I write for maybe one hour.

I'm not sleepy at all. Outside it's already getting bright. The mosquito has taken care of its task and has not shown up anymore.

When does the sun rise today? Google gives me ten minutes. I jump out of the bed and I dress up quickly. I put the mountain boots on tiding only the last pair of loops. I piss sitting on the dry toilet, I close the small lock that serves as symbolic security measure on one of the huge glass doors and I start running towards the beach.

I make a lot of noise on the path of gravel and sand. I know that a good part of the village is already up and I hope not to be taken for a runaway burglar. I pass by the bamboo huts, the dance tent, the house where Domi and Tex are being eaten alive by mosquitoes and I keep on running. There is always a moment after the initial agile sprint when the feet get heavier and the heart jumps up in the throat and this time too that forces me to slow down and ajust the pace. I pass the fabric labs, the school with the playground, the last houses.

I cross fast the sand road from which I arrived, that enters the village enclosing it from the north. I climb down the river bank going by a small group of bushes, I reach the water and I see it.
