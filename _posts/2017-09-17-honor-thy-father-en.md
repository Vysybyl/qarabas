My bike can take me anywhere but I haven't been able to catch the sunset yet. 

I was waiting for Y. in her car the other day. Some kids sneaked out of the favela and started playing around the car. I got out and lean on it, crossing my arms and staring at the moon which was getting bigger. I couldn't understand their accent. The sun was gone already. I smiled while a part of me was still suspicious of their activity. I felt ashamed and didn't look at them directly. Their noise grew.

All of a sudden Y. is on the other side of the car, talking with a short old man about the beauty of the night. He renews his invitation: "You should come next Saturday!" We get into the car. Y. is delighted and exclaims "My God!" I realize she's staring through my window. For the first time I see a white horse crowded with kids passing a few steps from me. "Are you blind?" say Y. and my mind together. The moon shines and the old man is gone.

My bike is light and fast. During the day it's white, but at night my eyes see silver.

I was able to ride to the blue church at the five-way crossroad I spotted a few days ago. I woke up remembring the solid seed of fear I dug out the previous night, just before falling asleep. I pictured it as two small rocks, one next to the other, without touching. In my vision, I recognized one of them as my relationship with the woman who loves me. The other one is more indistinct. I dreamt it as a woman I don't know. My mind gasped a big "No!", my stomach cramped and I woke up.

I can't tell if my current fear of commitment is just a byproduct of my personal and family stories or the hint of a different call. If I look up my family tree I find incomprehension, lies, fears, betrayal, alcoholism, unacknowledged children, physical and verbal abuse, all firmly nested into my lineage's relationships. I am not dreaming on the nullpunkt anymore and I know this is not the way to look at things in Latin America, but I can't avoid considering all of this. I am also well aware that my pre-programmed desire to get married and settle down comes from far away through blood and TV. Anytime the teenage fear of being gay has come back, it looked more like an ancestral need to be loved, accepted and understood and less like actual sex drive.

Most of the men of my age who became husbands and happy fathers seem to have invented a new parenting style. Maybe some sort of silent revolution is happening? I clearly remember one of my asian cousins - mother of two - who seemed really thoughtful when she said to me "Making a family is happiness too, you know?". What is their nullpunkt? What do I not see?

The sun is already low when I enter the church. A song is playing loudly but I can't grab the refrain. Somebody says on the PA: "Let's welcome our brother... " (I can't understand the name). Everybody rise. The priest starts talking about sin. His tone is livelier then the one I'm used to, but I get distracted by the building's columns and windows. The city should have no more then a hundred and fifty years, but the church looks older. It's beautiful and light.
"Sin is everywhere" continues the priest. "How many husbands cheat on their wives? How many wives do the same, even with other married men? How many times the sons or the daughters break the fourth commandment and lie to their parents? Let's all bow our heads in sign of atonement and pray the Lord for forgiveness."
I count myself in the number and lower my chin, but the forgiveness I long for does not come from God. I leave the church a few minutes later to check on the bike. It's still there at the end of the staircase. I sit on the steps by the lady-of-the-night to enjoy the flowers' scent. I can see some street-inhabitants sit next to me[^homeless]. A message by Y. tells me to go check the literature exhibition. The sun is not orange yet.

When we entered the **terreiro** it was night already. 0., Y.'s mother, is with us. I feel no fear getting in Carabás favela for the first time with these two women. The father of the saint sits on a chair facing the entrance of a wide room paved with tiles. A line of men and a line of women stands before him facing each other. They are all barefoot and dressed in white. One of the girls is holding a baby with a white lace dress. My first instinct is to take off my shoes, but I realize only the people in the white clothings are barefoot, so I walk to a bench by the wall and sit there. I feel misplaced. One of the girls is extremely beautiful. The father of the saint asks us to come close and he makes us present ourselves.

The exhibition is in a building next to a square I already know. One of the doormen wants to check the weight of my bike. "It's really light and fast," I say, "but the gear is fixed". I show him how the wheel moves together with the pedals in both directions. When he approached me I was afraid I had put it in the wrong place. I enter the glass pavillion, which hosts several book stands and smells terribly because of baking cheese bred. I go to the end of the hallway, where three rounds of steps cut in the ground shape an oval stage. Several round tables fill the space, with a few books on each of them. The books on the same table have the same color. Some tables have people. I browse a book on sustainable growth in Brazil. I let it down and move to another table. I pick another one, open it and read.

The cerimony lasts several hours. The voices and the three drums in the corner stop briefly only in-between songs. First, the father of the saint dances in front of the boys and transforms himself. He is promptly given new cloths, a long colored sheet that is wrapped several times around his waist and chest and lays back in two long tails. His gentle feet know well the earth. Calling a new song, he dances again in small steps in front of the boys. He touches and transforms each one of them. They raise strange calls. Their bodies freeze, shake and bow to touch the ground. Their voices change and they start to dance. 
The father of the saint is transforming the girls. The figures seem to wake up from a sleep. They recognize each other and exchange hugs and greetings. A party crowd is building up in front of us.
For a while, the people in white disappear into the other room to come back with a new look: a colourful skirt, a hat, jewels, cigars, cigarettes and drinks. Each figure has a few distinctive ornaments.  A tall skinny boy with a heavy necklace and a black skirt spins without spilling a single drop of wine from his glass. A gigantic guy which smokes a cigar with the light top inside of his mouth comes to greet us. His voice is hoarse and he wears a black sombrero all the way down to his eyes. I find him extremely friendly and fun. He offers us some of the cachaça he's drinking: the liquid was poured in a half coconut shell and to pass it he puts it on the ground. To give it back I have to put it next to my left foot. He picks it up.

Several figures come to meet us. Some shake hands, some other hug us. The rest talk to each other and to the few other people that are attending, dance and sing. The voice in my mind that analyses the event from a psychological point of view doesn't bother me too much. At a certain moment my spine is stretched up and I look around for some time with new eyes. There is an altar in the middle of the room. Another one on my left. The music is strong enough to cover the speakers from the other houses of Carabás. 
After some minutes I feel exhausted and I want water. I fell down into myself and I want to sleep. Y. is next to me so I hold her hand. The father of the saint calls us from the inner room. It's our time.

*Here's a warning: do not read, unless you are ready to take a serious risk*

The first line I read is enough. I smile to the man and say: "May I talk to you?"
