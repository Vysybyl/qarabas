The man in front of me is slim and has got an egg-shaped face. He's leaning on the chair with a relaxed look, half complacent, but his eyes and smile when he greets me are humble and kind.

\- It's an audacity[^ousadia] - he confesses as soon as I confirm that he's the author. His first book.

\- In which sense? What is at stake?

\- The risk is the one that the written word always carries with itself. It's a mirror for the one who writes. We end up uncovering a side of ourselves which we couldn't access in any other way.

\- But it's a mirror for reader too, isn't it?

\- Yes, of course. Writing has the power of showing us a glimpse of ourselves, an echo... And even who writes ends up revealing himself.

\- That is the risk? To be discovered?

\- That one too.

\- But it's also the risk to be misunderstood. There always exists the risk that the reader mistake the author for his invention.

\- Yes.

I read a one-page story. There is a dense silence.

\- It's kind of an unpleasant feeling this one... It doesn't happen everyday to be reading the book next to the writer.

We laugh.

\- It is a bit strange. But it's also interesting.

A girl that already knows the man arrives to present him to her friend. I continue reading.

He sells one book. Once they stop talking he wants to offer me a copy. I believe he's younger than me.

\- It's already sold! - I tell him - Don't worry.

We both sport long nails on the right hand. I ask him if he'd like to be a professional writer.

\- I have this fear of publishing too - I confess. - For a very long time I thought that it was fundamental for an artist to live off his art. My family is not rich and being economically independent has always been part of my education. A kind of pride. I tried several paths but I always ended up working in call centers. So, eventually, I decided to invest in a technical profession and I went back to university.

\- But the click happened when, a few years ago, I found on youtube a few interviews to some of the best Italian poets from the last century, those ones that in Italy you study at school. And I discovered that most of them were professors or something similar. They all had humble jobs. That's why I ask you.

\- Well, I am myself a high-school teacher. I think that my job feeds me and gives me writing material. Maybe in a few decades I will have stocked enough experience - he smiles - and I will like the idea to commit myself to writing alone. But not for now. I think that keeping contact with...

\- Reality.

\- ... reality allows your writing to better reach people.

\- And have you ever thought that you might offend somebody?

\- There always exists that risk, and maybe some fear...

\- That someone would come after you with a stick...

\- ... but I do not control the effects that my writings have on people. Clearly I do not write to offend anyone, but I can't control it any more than I can make the readers find any value in what I do.

\- But, don't you always write with an intention?

\- Yes, there is an intention but... You see, when you write, you often do not know what you'll be writing. You do know that you want to write about a certain subject (that is the intention) but you do not know what will come out. You only realize it as you go on.

He's not from here. I ask him to recommend me some events from the exhibition. He tells me about a conference on the role of the black writer in Brazil.

\- You know, it's still an uncommon figure in Brazil, because of the stereotypes and of the greater difficulties in culture and education access.

His skin is darker than mine. Our last questions caught us while we were saying goodbye. We remain standing in front of the chairs, talking and smiling. By looking at him while he speaks I feel such a immediate and total connection that several years ago seemed to need to be fixed or explained. Not anymore.
