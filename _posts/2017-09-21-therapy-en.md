It's brass monkey weather. I sat on the wall for maybe one hour, while the wind blew hard on me through the wide spaces that divide the buildings here. I meditated, wrote and read trying to kill time and pluck up courage; then I moved, I got in and started searching every floor.

It's another building, I'm told. Once again I'm outside in the cold; I should have brung the heavy sweater. I check the chart hanging by the entrance.

Not here.

The chat on the phone is still quiet. It's night already. I walk away. In the parking lot I flinch seeing a man standing still in the dark. I realize he's some kind of security guard. I keep walking towards what seems to be the closest street. My sense of direction works poorly in this city: maybe it's the light, the magnetic field or the streets cut at a sharp angle.

There is enough silence here. I unlock the phone: nothing. I breathe and press the mic icon. I keep it pressed.

I record silence for the most but in the end I feel better. I call an Uber.

***

"What?" I almost never understand the first time they talk to me.

"Do you want the AC on? Some water?"

"No, no AC thanks. Do you have water?"

He hands me a plastic cup sealed with aluminium foil. It's cold but not too much. The driver wears glasses and has grizzled hair, short.

The car is following an avenue that cuts the city in half. In another country it would be a highway. I always feel that some sort of intimacy arises when you share a car. I had some of the best talks in Lisbon with taxi drivers, even when I was sober. This is my second Uber.

"Would you like to hear a story?"

"What?"

I try to change the accent: "Wanna here a story?"

"Speak out".

I explain in broad terms the encounter two years before and everything that came afterwards.

"... and now she doesn't even want to see me".

The driver is reluctant, but I insist.

"If I may say my opinion, that gal for me is a bit bipolar... But for me you shouldn't run after her".

"And what should I do?"

"Have fun! It is very true that, when you like someone, you like someone. But you are in Latin America, enjoy it! Go out, have a drink, have some fun..."

"You think I should take care of myself?"

"Exactly, take care of yourself. Show that you are having fun - but do not mention other women".

Too late, I think.

"Women like that, when you run after them, they run faster".

The reason of her behaviour, that I could not understand during that car trip, becomes partially clear only as I am writing this. My reason is still obscure.

Taking care of myself.

The room was softly illuminated. The center was occupied by a double mattress laying on the floor, covered with a white silk-paper sheet. The portable stereo was playing some kind of relaxing music I can't recall.

The therapist greeted me, made me sit and asked me how I got to know the place and why I was there. I start talking randomly about childhood memories and past relationships, until I get to the dream. I giggle nervously while I tell how it ends:
"... I feel the pain exploding while she looks at me with her eyes popping, presses her finger deeper into my flesh and keeps repeating: <<There's a lot of fear here, lot of fear!>>".

It's the same old dream that made me contact Y. the first time. Everything seems connected.

The therapist listens, asks me if I already knew about Tantra when I had the dream, gives me a general explanation of the practice's philosophy and purposes and tells me what will happen during the session; then tells me to lay on the mattress. I drop the clothes on a chair and position myself on the bed facing the ceiling.

"You must breathe deeply, in a cycle, with no pauses. Imagine that the inbreath and the outbreath are like sea waves coming and going"

"From the mouth?" 

"Yes. From the mouth."

I close my eyes.

***

I kept them closed for a while even after it was all over. I had to stop the respiration a couple of times to try to gather some water in my mouth and swallow it to moist my dry throat. 

While the music volume went down, I regained control over my body. I was overwhelmed by feelings and I wanted to hug the therapist. I could still feel the two presences on my left and right side. They had't shown up for several months and now they were back. They seemed to have sprung out of my last floating ribs when the therapist's hands reached them. I recognized the male one on my right as my grandfather. The points from where they have raised are still tickly: as I touch them I laugh a heavy laughter and shake a bit. I'm experiencing a state I've only witnessed in others before. Something feminine.
I am flooded with joy. My heart is light and open with clarity. I wish everybody was able to live this condition.

The core of my experience was not physical but emotional. During the session I felt an excruciating pain for the loss of the loved ones. Not just the people I miss, but the grief of my friends, my father and my family. I mourned the grandfather I have never known (the one whose presence still inhabited the room) and tapped the pain my parents must have felt when they lost their parents. 

"People disappear!"

This sentence echoed several times in my mind with the tone of a question, while the therapist's palms rested on my chest or on the top of my head or the fingers wriggled gently on my skin like liquid silk waves. It was still haunting me while my abdominal muscles contracted in seizures as the therapist's touch released chills of pleasure, tickling and sorrow that broke from my stomach up into my chest as a mixture of laughters and cry.

Finally, the sentence answered itself: "People disappear! For this reason we have children". 

Its meaning was clear. People suffer for the loss of their beloved ones and have children to stop that pain. It was that simple. There is no real healing for loss - as nothing will fill that gap - but having a child is somehow a way to embrace the ineluctability of death and reply with hope. To the daunting reality of "They are all dead or they will die" it contraposes the equally true statement "They were all born or they will born". This relation doesn't even out the abyss of death, but balances it with the strenght of life. The chain of my ancestors is a chain of births as much as it is a chain of deaths. I am in that chain and by having a child I seal my own ring: I entrust someone else to take care of the openness of time once I am departed and, meanwhile, I give him or her the possibility to mourn my end. 

Having a child is a statement of acceptance of mortality and finiteness. So my father was for his father, so I am for my father, so someone might be for me one day.

I wash myself in the near bathroom and I put the clothes back on. The price of the service, that I have avoided to ask, offends me. I do not have enough money with me. While I ride the bike to the ATM, in some part of me malice regains ground and judges coldly everything that has just happened.
