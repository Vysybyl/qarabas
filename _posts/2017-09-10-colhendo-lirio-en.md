"Did you come because of me?" asks Y. 

I have a fat ice-cream cone in my hand. I chose flavors of fruits that I've never seen and that I will never remember.

We went to the park today. We got in on our bikes a few minutes after the closing time and we stopped next to an artificial stream with a little waterfall. "Water!" exclaimed Y. There is a low tiny fence with a sign that reads "Respect the fences", so Y. leaps gently over it and goes to dip her hands. "Waterfall!" a little girl screams while running by us and I suddenly remember the song. I ask Y. to sing and I realize I've always got the lyrics wrong. The trees around us rise and bend like a ceiling.

I've found home. A house too big for just one person. But while my house-mate is away I have it all for me. A bed, a table to work and now a hint of palo santo. Ow, and it has a dream-like hammock swinging on the porch. My luggage is still packed and my stuff is spread all over the bedroom floor, but I will be able to dream and create here and the slum is not too far.

The Carabás favela occupy all the valley and the hill behind Y.'s house and keeps on on the other side. I was expecting a complete mess of tinplate walls and roofs, but I find instead a small colorful village way more charming then the city that surrounds it. Y. explains to me: "When we arrived the favela ended down there. Here you only had wasteland". The low brick buildings have climbed the slope up to our fence. Several parts seem to be still under construction: a formwork here, some iron beams stuck in the air there. "A lot of them are construction workers, the same ones that build the 'official' houses in the rest of the city. They themselves have the knowledge to build all this".

I's surprised to see that many lights and I ask myself how is it possible that the slum have access to the power grid. Music is played loud during most of the day and part of the night too. Y. does not really know how to answer, but the wires that go down the poles seem to be handmade. Maybe what the company loses by feeding these lamps and radios for free is not worth the investment of sending somebody to cut everything? There exist between the slum and the neighborhood way less discontinuities then I imagined.

Nevertheless, when the owners of these lots decide to take them back, or when the city decides to build on these lands a highway or a shopping center, the police and the bulldozers come.

"Did you come because of me?"

From the door of my new house you need five minutes to climb up to a small square where you can see the tall buildings of the center. We visited one of them at the end of the afternoon, after the park close. It has some huge banners hanging on the facade. The entrance gates are locked with chains and to get in we had to talk with a guy holding a walkie-talkie in his hand and record our names on a book. I've never seen such an organized squat.

"Communication and security is the most important" explains to me the girl who will lead us. The building has a facebook page.

The entrance is illuminated by the lights of the empty shops. The building had stayed unused for years when the new residents settled in. It seems to me that the only things that were broken are the ones which blocked the access to some part of the construction: a few doors and some shutters.

The community has a cafeteria, a vegetable garden, a kinderganten, communication offices and a meeting room. I see no hammocks but I think the terrace may compete with my porch. I feel some background fear during the entire visit and I can't say if it's coming from me or if there actually is a dense vibe. I count the exits and I try to guess the juridical status of a foreigner arrested during a raid. Our guide tells me that, in case of police attack, they usually put the white people in the front and students or guys with university cloths too. She also says that a teenage girl was shot in the jaw and will have to pass through four years of plastic surgery. They are collecting funds for her.

Now I imagine myself wearing my IST's grey sweat-shirt, while a cop aims to the word "Mathematics" and comments "Never liked it". But at that moment I could only compare internally my skin tone with Y.'s and conclude that she'd have to go to the front. I felt ashamed of my thoughts and I started chatting with the guide. I told her how occupations work in Milan: the public houses that stay empty just because there is no money for some small renovations, the anarchists, the immigrants and the mafias; and how people of all kind gather in front of other people's houses when the eviction comes. She's studying at the university: "I think that squatting is the future of architecture".

While leaving we pass by some children maybe four or five year old.

The ones from the slum and the squatters owns a nullpunkt completelly different from mine. I can only fill the gap between us with some kind of sense of guilt: here I am inventing my love stories, I can travel around the world and work wherever I want while these people eat bullets. I know that this feeling comes from myself only and does not add anything to the story, but I can't find another one.

"I can see all the stories: mine, the one of my family, yours, the one of my ancestors and of my friends, the ones of those living in the favela,,, And I do not know what to do with them. They will not give me the warmth of a hug nor find a home for the squatters. They seem useless" I said to Y. in the ice-cream parlour.

"But those stories exist to be told. The girl will have surgery and smile again because somebody told her story".

The night falls quickly here. It doesn't get dark, it turns out.

"Did you come because of me?"

I think about the home I could have not found without her. "As well. I would not be here if it wasn't for you".

She speaks for the two of us: "I feel that we are more friends than anything else".

"I know" I say calmly. There is an old man in the favela.

"When will you take me to meet the father of the saint?"

[^song]: Translation: *Today I saw mother Oxum at the waterfall / sitting by the riverside / picking liliums, lee-ree-a-lay / picking liliums, lee-ree-a-lo / picking liliums to adorn her home*.         
         The correct version is: *Eu vi mamã Oxum na cacholeira / sentada na beira do rio / colhendo lírio, lírio lê / colhendo lírio, lírio lá / colhendo lírio para enfeitar seu congá* (tr: *I saw mommy Oxum at the waterfall / ... / picking liliums to adorn her altar* )
